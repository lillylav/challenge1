##Description:
Horiseon is a marketing company with a website to explain their services to their customers and generate leads. For this project they wanted to improve accessibility and clean up the source code. To achieve this I added semantic elements to define the structure of the site, added alt tags to the images acknowledging them as decorative, confirmed that all HTML elements and headings follow a logical structure and order, and added a title. I also cleaned up the CSS side consolidating duplicate formatting and removing unnecessary classes on the HTML side.
